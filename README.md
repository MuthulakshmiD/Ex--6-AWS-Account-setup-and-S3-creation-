# Aim:
The goal of this project is to create an AWS S3 bucket, configure its permissions, and upload a set of files while managing access control to ensure proper security and compliance with best practices.

# Problem Statement:
Organizations need a reliable and secure method to store and manage large amounts of data. AWS S3 is a cloud storage solution that provides highly scalable, durable, and available storage. The challenge is to create an S3 bucket, manage permissions, and efficiently store and retrieve files, ensuring security and compliance with organizational policies.

# Algorithm:
1.Initialize AWS SDK or AWS CLI: Use the AWS SDK or AWS CLI to interact with the AWS S3 service.

2.Create an S3 Bucket:
  . Provide a unique name for the bucket.

  . Choose a region.

  . Configure bucket settings such as versioning and logging.

3.Set Permissions:

  . Define the public access settings.

  . Configure access control lists (ACL) or IAM roles and policies to grant appropriate access to users.

4.Upload Files:

  . Use AWS SDK, CLI, or S3 console to upload files to the S3 bucket.

  . Ensure proper permissions are set on the uploaded files.

5.Set Retention Policies (optional):

Configure lifecycle policies for automatic file archiving or deletion after a set period.

6.Test the Bucket Configuration:

Upload and retrieve a file to test the bucketâ€™s functionality and security settings.
